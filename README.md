###Evaluating Key Indicators of Heart Disease

**The goal** of the project is to test different factors in order to detect the ones that have the greatest impact on heart disease, which will ultimately serve in helping us find ways to prevent them. We also want to identify which demographics (race and gender) are more at risk, as well as which lifestyle factors are most relevant to the prevalence of heart disease. All of these will help in providing relevant and timely support to the groups most at risk.  

**We are interested in this problem because** heart disease is one the leading causes of death, leading to ~ 930,000 deaths/year in the US alone, and $229 billion in healthcare costs/year according to CDC. Identifying the factors that play a role in causing heart diseases will help reduce these losses.


** Data Source**: The dataset comes from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease   
The original dataset of nearly 300 variables was reduced to just about 20 variables by Kamil Pytlak on Kaggle. We will try using the original file from the CDC for the purposes of our analysis, linked here (the file is in ASCII format, and we will discuss with sir on how best to access it): https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2020/files/LLCP2020ASC.zip
